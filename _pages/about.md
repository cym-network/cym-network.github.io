I am a Ph.D. student in the Institute of Network Science and Cyberspace at Tsinghua University, advised by [Prof. Yuanjie Li](http://www.yuanjiel.com/). My research interests include satellite networks and mobile networks.

Previously, I received my Bachelor’s degree in Communications Engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
